SuiBot
=====================
SuiBot is simplistic IRC bot written in C#.

Compilation
-------
Just download the code, open TwitchBotConsole.csproj with a either Visual Studios 2013 (or newer) or Xamarin Studio / Mono Develop.
First start may seem like a crash, but it should create a config file, where you can type in your username, password, channel the bots should join etc.
Once you've edited the config file, you should be good to go.
